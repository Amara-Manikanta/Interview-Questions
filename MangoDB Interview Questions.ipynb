    "-   It uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.\n",
    "-   It provides easy scalability and is a cross-platform, document-oriented database.\n",
    "-   MongoDB works on the concept of Collection and Document.\n",
    "-   It combines the ability to scale out with features such as secondary indexes, range queries, sorting, aggregations, and geospatial indexes.\n",
